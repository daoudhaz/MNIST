# MNIST
Using the MNIST handwritten data set, we take the amplitude and phase of the fourier transform of
each image. We train an encoder-decoder neural network that takes amplitude and phase as inputs
to reconstruct the original image at the output, as shown in the diagram below. Then we explore the
latent space for interesting insights.
